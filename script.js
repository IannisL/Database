// These are all arbitrary problems, but they demonstrate the simplicity of working with arithmetic and comparisons in programming. No matter the complexity of the task in front of you, you will always use these core operators to accomplish it.

// For example, instead of console.log(isValid), we could write console.log (`The four numbers are valid according to the provided criteria: ${isValid}.`) or something similar.
